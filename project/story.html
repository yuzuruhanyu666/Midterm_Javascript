      <h1 id="title"> Neighborhood Restaurant Acess in Philadelphia</h1>

      <h2 id="title2"> Introduction</h2>
      <p id="description"> There are over 6,000 places to dine in Philadelphia, emphasizing their importance to the way we eat and the need to have healthy options while eating out. However, the number of restaurants in different block groups does vary a lot in Philadelphia. According to the Philadelphia open data, the range of the number of restaurants in each block group is from 0 to 136 and itâ€™s really hard to visualize with the specific number for each block group. Therefore, I use the quantile classification to divide them into five categories which are 0, 1-2, 3-4, 5-8 and more than 8. As shown in the map, the darker blue is, the more restaurants are. While the lighter yellow is, the less restaurants are. It's meaningful to do this analysis to help planners and city decide where to develop restaurants in the future.
